# Practice Python Repository

Welcome to the **Practice Python** repository! This repository is a collection of Python scripts and examples aimed at helping developers improve their Python programming skills through hands-on practice. The repository covers a range of topics, from basic programming concepts to advanced patterns and techniques.

## Features

### 1. **Design Patterns**
- **Decorator Pattern**: Illustrates how decorators can add functionality dynamically.
- **Factory Pattern**: Demonstrates object creation techniques with factories.
- **Proxy Pattern**: Explains how proxy objects can control access to other objects.

### 2. **Data Manipulation and Algorithms**
Located in the `/common/` directory:
- Prime number factorization (`prime_factors.py`)
- Working with dequeues (`deque.py`)
- Lambda expressions and list comprehensions (`lambda_expr.py`, `list_comprehensions.py`)
- String operations: reverse, sort (`reverse_string.py`, `sort_string.py`)
- Palindrome checks (`palindrome.py`)
- Generating random numbers (`random_number.py`)
- Simple statistical calculations (`stat.py`)

### 3. **JSON Handling**
Located in the `/JSON/` directory:
- Reading and parsing JSON files (`json_to_py.py`)
- Sample JSON data for testing (`data.json`)
- Unit testing for JSON-related operations (`test.py`)

### 4. **Matplotlib Visualizations**
Located in the `/Matplotlib/` directory:
- Bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and pie charts (`Bar.py`, `Scatter.py`, `Histogram.py`, `pie.py`)
- Subplots and advanced plotting techniques (`Subplot.py`, `Labels.py`)
- Annotating and customizing plots (`Marker.py`, `Plotting.py`, `Pyplot.py`)
- Examples include sample images for reference in `/images`.

### 5. **Debugging Tools**
- Introduces the `icecream` library for better debugging (`debug/` directory).

### 6. **Parallel Programming**
- Basic introduction to parallel programming concepts (`parallel-programming/` directory).
